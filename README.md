# Containerization_of_DjangoTut

Note: This is mostly for learning purposes and the enjoyment of trying to program.

This is part 2 of my project to create a cybersecurity threat identification or vulnerabilities web package/app.

This repository is a continuation of my other repository in which I completed the Polls tutorial.

In this part, I am using Docker to create and manage one or more packaged instances of my web app, still as the polls website/app, and to create a persistent database for it.
I'm also planning to move from using an SQLite-based DB to a MySQL-based database, as well as setting up a volume for the web app and its web server on Docker.

I plan to summarize the purpose of some commits here if there are a lot of redundant ones, or if there are multiple commits that are centered around fixing the same problem.
